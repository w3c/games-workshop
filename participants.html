              <dt>Bio</dt>
              <dd>
                I'm a senior accessibility engineer at The Paciello Group, a company specialising in digital accessibility (web, mobile, apps). I have also been involved in accessible gaming research - you can find more info on that on my site: http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/research/<br/>
                I am a passionate supporter of accessibility in all areas, not just playing games but also helping people to create content (e.g. levels) for them too. Access to authoring tools (of any kind) and the communities around games is vital - not just for disabled gamers, but for the gaming community as a whole. So many new and diverse types of games have been created recently, some with great accessibility features, so we have a lot to build upon. Through several open-source projects I'm also active in web accessibility areas such as landmark navigation and chart sonification. Recently I joined the W3C's Accessible Platform Architectures group, who (amongst others) have reviewed the position paper to be submitted.</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>I'd really like to learn about game and platform developers' concerns and the challenges they perceive with respect to accessibility (and other areas) so that we can be sure to address those challenges specifically when considering accessibility. I'd like to contribute to the discussion around game accessibility by proposing some ways that we might start to create the infrastructure required to make the UI and communications features of games more accessible, and how to interface with gamers' existing assistive technologies. I think we could provide a good means for developers to provide the information these technologies need, and then we could expand our focus to other areas.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>I think there are some relatively low-hanging fruit with respect to integration of gamers' assistive technologies, as well as some much bigger and exciting challenges. I think it would be good to focus both on some of the short-/medium-term possibilities as well as think collectively about where we might go from there.</dd>

              <dd>I'm a Professor/Researcher at the University Côte d’Azur. I received my Ph.D. I conducts research on Web-Instrumented Man-Machine Interactions and Semantics in Inria/I3S’s Wimmics project team.<br/>I have been teaching Web technologies since 1994, and I'm the author of the HTML5 part 1 and part 2 courses on W3Cx (HTML5 Apps and Games is the title of this second MOOC).<br/>I'm also the W3C AC Rep of my University/Lab and a member of the WebAudio WG. I'm the national coordinator of a french national research project (the ANR WASABI project) that has WebAudio at its heart. We developped a WebAudio plugin standard and hosts/instruments/effects that support multiple programming langages (i.e JavaScript/FAUST/C++ etc.)<br/>I was the chair of the HTML5 games W3C track at WWW2016 in Montreal.</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>See if our WebAudio developments + plugin standard proposal can be used for some of the gaming industry use cases. Meet people from the Gaming industry.<br/>My focus is first on the audio part, but also on Web performance in a more general way.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>Performance and support for the diversity of devices that are available or could appear. PWA and Web installable games is a very promising lead that should ne further investigated (ways to store large assets, for example).</dd>

            <dl>
              <dt>Bio</dt>
              <dd>I am the Technical Lead for BBC Children's Games Team over in MediaCityUK, responsible for the technical aspect of all games on BBC Children's websites and apps, mainly HTML5/JS web games and apps. We have a special interest in gaming for children with an official remit of 0-13 age group. At the BBC we build a collection of in-house game engines designed to help 3rd party agencies build BBC games easier, quicker and cheaper. These are built in open source technologies such as Pixi and Phaser. Our main area of business is the publishing of HTML5 games to our websites, my team is responsible for the technical specificatons, delivery pipeline and platform the games are hosted on so I have a strong interest in how the games are built and how they are served to the audience. I am also the technical lead for the BBC's first ever online multiplayer web game called Nightfall which we've released in Beta (UK only).</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>As a newcomer to these kind of events I'd like to make some contacts in the industry and start helping the BBC be more proactive in the wider industry from a games point of view. I have a strong interest in improving the audience experience so I will be bringing a set of problems with me that I hope to discover how the wider industry solves those problems and how we can work together to support a healthier gaming ecosystem for the audience. Problems include how do we keep up with the rapidly shifting sands of the device market introducing new notches and screen sizes and folding phones and how do we transport one code base between multiple platforms. and of course I am super interested in future technology that will enable better games to be playable via the web or what the potential of games as PWAs are and what steps I can start taking in that direction.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>The workshop should focus on the future technologies that can alter the web gaming paradigm such as web assembly and webgpu or cloud gaming - technologies that remove the existing limitations of browser based gaming. Another angle to explore other impediments to web gaming such as the full screen API not being supported, internal browsers locking orientation, the lack of a universal audio format - these all impact negatively on the audience's experience and our ability to offer a satisfying game.</dd>

              <dd>I'm part of the W3C technical team, where I serve as Media & Entertainment Champion, exploring areas on the Web that might benefit from standardization. This workshop on Web games is the result of initial discussions I held with a few experts in the field. I also prepared a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/games/">Roadmap for Web games</a> that lists relevant technologies for games and their current status</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>I want to learn more about specific issues that game developers and game engines have to deal with to have games run on the Web, either directly or through cloud streaming.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>From a standardization perspective, I believe that what would be useful is to focus on:
                <ul>
                  <li>a timeline for relevant features under standardization</li>
                  <li>new features that can make progress right away</li>

              <dd>I've worked with web technology on several products over the years, from the early days of open source Mozilla, to a WebKit-based mobile browser, to Zephyr.js, a Node-like environment for embedded IoT devices. Currently, I'm working with the <a href="https://github.com/open-webrtc-toolkit">Open WebRTC Toolkit</a> team at Intel, and we are interested in the cloud gaming use case and improvements to streaming, as well as hybrid techniques for game delivery that take advantage of client hardware capabilities.</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>I'd like to understand the expected advances in web gaming, and see how our project could be expanded to support them, and how we could contribute to their definition and development. I haven't been W3C events before so I also just hope to learn how the collaboration is done and how to participate in the future. I don't have any agenda to push, but I will try to be prepared to share some learnings from my team's project.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>For 3D rendering, there is a finite set of gaps between WebGL 2.0 and native APIs, and a goal should probably be a ranked list of the top concerns that affect game quality. Most of the other topics seem more open-ended. I would think people need to bring their best ideas and known problems, to share and discuss. I would expect the right goals for these would be to determine together which suggestions are the most feasible and have the widest applicability and impact.</dd>

                Now at Xiaomi, I'm leading a Web engine team aimed at developing Web engine/runtime based on Chromium for Xiaomi browser and HTML5 Web Game products, enabled three web game products by Xiaomi (MiniGame, QuickApp Game, and QuickGame) with optimized WebGL performance and enhanced Web features.<br/>
                Our team are also doing research on new Web technologies include WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebXR and WebRTC, in order to bring new web technologies into Xiaomi Web game products and Xiaomi mobile/VR devices.<br/>
                I've worked on Web technology and Chromium project for several years and have committed patches to Chromium on areas including WebGL, Canvas, media and etc.<br/>
                Before joining Xiaomi, I worked at Intel and was a core developer of the Crosswalk Web Runtime and was in charge of optimization of HTML5 Gaming (WebGL and Canvas) performance of Crosswalk.
              </dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>
                Since our team is developing web engine/runtime for Xiaomi HTML5 Web Game products, we are looking forward to joining discussions of fundamental Web specifications and implementations for Web gaming (WebGL, Canvas, WebAudio and WebRTC), as well as learning new Web gaming specifications evolution including WebAssembly, WebGPU.<br/>
                Performance is a critical issue in HTML5 Web Gaming, we did several optimizations in the runtime for web gaming targeting mobile devices, including Web Game mode in web runtime with reduced power consumption and improved rendering FPS, we'd like to share our practice and discuss optimization technology with game engine vendors.<br/>
                For advanced rendering in Web Game, we are also looking forward to study new technology like physically based rendering in Web for AR/VR scene and seeking the chance to bring WebXR into our Web gaming products and Xiaomi VR devices.
              </dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>
                For HTML5 Games, the evolution WebGPU is critical for game rendering performance, the workshop could make it clearer of WebGPU standard evolutiaon such as shading language of WebGPU and give roadmap of WebGPU standard.<br/>
                WebAssembly is also promising for Web game, game engine vendors could focus more on the WebAssembly support.<br/>
                And for WebXR, the specification is still quite unstable, it would be much better to establish stable WebXR specification, so that browser vendors can implement WebXR more quickly, and then game developers can develop rich AR/VR scene.

My explorations into video game technologies take the form of Conceptual Art, interactive music videos, activations for partner organizations, or actually sometimes indie arcade games.<br/>I want gaming or non-gaming on the web to be the best it can. </dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>I think the goals for the workshop should be to focus on the current technical hurdles and pain points, address the future pain points (fragmentation in native graphics API, the limitations of rendering with WebGL 1.0/2.0), address browser makers entering the streaming gaming market and the technologies they are leveraging inside their browsers, address rumored future limitation on the use of WebGL content from a certain browser maker.   Discuss how WebXR will change everything. </dd>

                I am an innovation designer with a background in mechanical engineering. For me, at their core, design and engineering are about one thing. Solving a human problem. They use different tools and techniques to achieve this. One relies on hard science and the other on emotional intelligence. However, both disciplines are about noticing problems and developing solutions to make a positive impact on the world. Thus, by using the two in tandem, I can deliver something that is reliable, feasible and valuable. My approach is human-centred oriented to identify problems and solutions that add value to enhance and enrich peoplesâ€™ lives in a simple, easy and cost-effective manner. I enjoy designing, making and testing physical & digital products. I relish taking ideas and making them real. My current role looks at assisting a research team at the University of York in translating and transforming their research for knowledge exchange and information dissemination to cystic fibrosis (CF) stakeholders including people with CF, medical professionals and the healthcare industry around infection control and architecture. The exhibition will be both physical and virtual, aiming to collect views and experiences from stakeholders involved in delivering CF care by using innovative inclusive design methodologies, to deliver a virtual exhibition using WebVR and 3D models of the clinic spaces to visualise the research through the experiences of healthcare professionals and patients. (See <a href="https://hamzaoza.github.io/parc/">prototype demo</a>) I also have experience in <a href="https://hamzaoza.com/projects/the-architect-android-game/">making games for Android</a> using the Unity3D game engine.

I am interested to learn more about the future of web games, VR and AR experiences and how they can be inclusively designed for to provide useful and positive experiences for people around the world.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>The web is increasingly being experienced through devices that do not have dedicated graphics cards so how can you maintain a consistent experience for all without penalising people who do not have access to the best hardware. When the Appstore was first launched, one of the key things Apple did, was produce a Human Factors framework to aid designers and developers in creating their apps for improved user experience. It would be prudent to discuss the development a similar framework for Web Games particularly around user interactions and browser events to maintain expected behaviours between browsers.

              <dd>I am currently the technical artist and creative lead for the Babylon.js team at Microsoft. I spent around 22 years as a graphic designer, photographer and creative director working in print and web before changing industries to work as a 3D artist and technical artist in real-time rendering. I have worked on one of the initial teams developing experiences for the launch of Microsoft's Hololens before working on Microsoft's efforts with monocular RGB 3D scanning using real-time reconstruction on a mobile device. I then joined the Babylon.js team and have been working toward improving our rendering technology and adding features that are needed in the games industry. I have been with the team through the last few releases and look forward to how Babylon.js can contribute to the advancement of web technology.</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>One of the core pillars of the Babylon.js team is that we engage with our open source community to listen to their needs and determine how we can unblock our users in a strategic way that will push the engine forward and solve the larger problems that blocked them. I see this workshop as an extension of that mission where we have the opportunity to hear from others in the industry about the problems they face and where they see the tech needing to go. This will help us in our development of the engine.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>I would love to see actionable items stem from these conversations. If everyone says we need multi-threading on the web (which we do) yet there are no concrete steps laid out to achieve that goal we are wasting our time. I would love to have attendees in the position of enacting changes take those changes back to their team. I know that I will be there to bring back information to the Babylon.js team that we can take action on to help improve the state of tooling for web technology and I hope there are others in the same position.</dd>

              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>"To have a two-way discussion with web game developers about storage.<br/>
                As a browser storage implementer, I can help provide guidance about the realities of current storage implementations in Firefox and our implementation plans going into the meeting.<br/>
                I would also like to better understand and discuss:
                <ul>
                  <li>Web game storage use-cases and implementation choices their developers have made.</li>
                  <li>What API changes or under-the-hood optimizations they think would be helpful.</li>
                  <li>What we as browser vendors can do to help improve documentation around the APIs and realistic real-world performance and persistence implications.</li>
                  <li>Interaction between how games are hosted and the origin-centric, single-bucket storage model currently used by the web and discussion of how multiple buckets could work for games and whether they'd be useful.</li>
                  <li>The balancing act of resource usage among games and the rest of the content in a user's browser.  (This centers more on the WICG page-lifecycle proposal, but storage APIs will also be involved.)</li>
                  <li>Privacy and storage.  Browsers have private browsing/incognito modes that can result in different storage limits and performance.</li>
                </ul>
                There are interesting discussions here both about how users may intentionally use this mode for games, as well as the browser's need to balance performance characteristics so that sites don't disable themselves on private browsing mode.

              <dd>I am a software developer at King in Stockholm. More specifically, I am part of the Defold team (www.defold.com), which is developing a free game engine. Our engine makes it simple to develop a game and then bundle it for different platforms, HTML5 being one among them. We've recently added support for WebAssembly, via the use of the Emscripten compiler.</dd>
              <dt>Goals</dt>
              <dd>Topics we especially care about How can games load and store hundreds of MB of assets in the background The Web platform has limited support for multithreading operations How can game input APIs be extended to detect keys' physical locations on a game controller Common Web GPU API? Vulkan for web or alike? Can we have Web Vulkan so we donâ€™t have to implement yet another API. Perhaps for emscripten folks? And what about better debugging tools for WebAssembly? Also, I'd like to create new contacts who one can ask questions now and then.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>Better knowledge about existing or new tools one might need. Better knowledge about the road map for web games. Also, some contacts or groups one can reach out to for more detailed help in the future.</dd>

              <dd>We are in the process of standardizing new ways to let the web apps get the user input on the worker side. We believe this is particularly useful for the game developers to not only do their graphics on the worker side but also handle the user input off the main thread. I would love to hear what other game developers think about this proposal and whether I can find anyone interested partners we can work through the API design and possibly have them to be our early adopter.</dd>
              <dt>Workshop goals</dt>
              <dd>Looking at the description of the workshop it seems to be mainly focused on the rendering work. I'm curious whether there is anything related to input that we can also focus on in this workshop. I'm wondering whether the game developers don't care about input latency as it is not that big of a deal at this point or was is just something that has been missed.</dd>
