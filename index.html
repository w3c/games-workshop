          This is an <b>unofficial draft</b> call for participation to an <b>unconfirmed</b> W3C Workshop on Web Games.
        </p>
        <section id="intro">
          <h2 id="goals">
            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together browser vendors, game engines developers, games developers, game distributors, and device manufacturers <b>to enrich the Open Web Platform with additional technologies for games</b>, including action, casual, first-person shooter (FPS), multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG), sports, and Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality (VR/AR) games.</p>
          <p>The secondary goals of the workshop are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand how games can leverage the power of the Web as a social platform for discovery and sharing (e.g. through live streaming);</li>
            <li>Understand how browser-based interactions fit within games;</li>
            <li>Identify mechanisms, guidelines and gaps related to the accessibility of games on the Web;</li>
            <li>Identify business constraints and technical gaps for distributing games on the Web;</li>
            <li>Evaluate the opportunities for standardization of APIs and formats that would ease the development of games on the Web.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We won't just be listening to presentations. We will be actively participating in breakout sessions and working discussions covering <a href="#topics">topics identified as relevant to the participants</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id="topics">
            Which topics will be covered?
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>How can game developers <b>render stunning 3D graphics in real-time</b> on the Web? What are high-priority features that a Web GPU API should expose? Under what timeline should such features be developed for the Web platform not to fall behind?</li>
            <li>The Web platform has limited support for <b>multithreading operations</b> through Workers. How can games efficiently spread CPU intensive operations across CPU cores while maintaining complex hierarchical structures such as <em>octrees</em>?</li>
            <li>What <b>additional WebAssembly features</b> would make the Web a better <b>build target</b> for game engines that use high-level programming languages such as C++/C#/Rust? How to create efficient and easy to debug games on the Web?</li>
            <li>Similarly, what additional WebAssembly, Web IDL or HTML features are necessary to <b>provide WebAssembly with high-performance bindings to new and existing Web APIs defined in Web IDL</b> to ease integration with hardware inputs/outputs exposed on the Web and create hybrid WebAssembly/JavaScript game engines?</li>
            <li>What improvements to Web streaming technologies are needed for <b>cloud gaming</b>?</li>
            <li>How can <b>game input APIs</b> be extended to support advanced controller features (LEDs, vibration, screen) and the long tail of game-specific controllers (guitars, pedals, wheels, dancing pads, etc.)?</li>
            <li>Can usual <b>game monetization schemes</b> (game purchase, in-game microtransactions, subscriptions, ads) be used in Web games, especially in games that need to run offline? How can Web games leverage <b>blockchain</b> technologies for virtual assets management?</li>
            <li>What mechanisms may allow game developers to <b>detect Devtools exploration, extraction or tampering with of game assets</b> (models, code logic)? Can game assets be protected from such actions?</li>
            <li>A key promise of the Web is that applications do not need to be installed, but how can games <b>load and store hundreds of MB of assets in the background</b> to ensure a smooth user experience right from launch time? Converserly, how best to package and distribute games for offline execution?</li>
            <li>What capabilities &mdash;APIs, semantics, techniques for rendering, processing, personalization, customization, interoperability, etc.&mdash; can developers leverage to <b>ensure accessibility of games</b> even when the code needs to plug into <em>opaque</em> low-level input/output technologies?</li>
          </ul>

            How can I attend?
          </h2>
          <p>Attendance is <b>free</b> for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.</p>
          <p>If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the <span class="todo">registration form</span>. We want to fill the room with people with practical experience with authoring and distributing games, and with people involved in relevant Web technologies and their standardization.</p>
          <p>Because the venue can only accommodate so many people, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on <a href="#dates">these important dates</a>.</p>
          <p>As an alternative to the registration form, you are encouraged to submit a topic in the form of a <a href="#position-statement">position statement</a>.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Game engines developers,</li>
            <li>Game developers,</li>
            <li>Game distributors,</li>
            <li>Game devices manufacturers (e.g. gamepads, VR/AR headsets),</li>
            <li>Experts in relevant technologies (e.g. WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebXR, WebRTC, Gamepad, Web Audio),</li>
            <li>Experts in challenges and opportunities of games for people with disabilities,</li>
            <li>Browser vendors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="position-statement">
            How can I suggest a presentation?
          </h2>

          <p>This is a workshop, not a conference. Presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.</p>

          <p>In order to facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.</p>

          <p>If you wish to present on a topic, you can send a position statement to the Program Committee at &lt;<span class="todo">@w3.org</span>&gt; by the deadline (see <a href="#dates">important dates</a>). Our <a href="#committee">program committee</a> will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.</p>

          <p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your background on games and/or Web technologies;</li>
            <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on;</li>
            <li>Links to related supporting resources;</li>
            <li>Optionally, other topics you think the workshop should cover.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. Images should be included inline in HTML using base64-encoded data URIs. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The position statement and the input provided at registration time (e.g. bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</p>

            What is W3C?
          </h2>
          <p>
            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
            and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
            for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
            technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
            “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
            our members and our community.
